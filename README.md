# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks: the weird and the wonderful

<!-- TODO: insert DOI -->

Materials for a British Library, Digital Scholarship "hack and yack" workshop.

Zooniverse is probably the world’s most popular crowdsourcing platform, used by dozens of cultural heritage organisations. But the resulting annotations from Zooniverse can be hard to use ‘as is’. Do you want to learn how to turn Zooniverse data into something you can use in catalogues, on web pages or in research? Then this session is for you! Zooniverse: how to download and analyse your task annotations will introduce the widely used Zooniverse platform and the services it offers, and share new developments in using the Library’s IIIF items on Zooniverse. Then we get hands-on! You’ll learn how to process your annotations to obtain a clean and readable spreadsheet for your project.
